## 🔧 **Technical Stack**

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Core Framework** | Python 3.11+ | Modern async/await patterns |
| **Protocol** | Model Context Protocol | AI agent integration |
| **Communication** | WebSockets + HTTP | Real-time + reliable execution |
| **Notebook Engine** | Jupyter Server API | Kernel management |
| **Image Processing** | Base64 encoding | Multi-format extraction |
| **Testing** | pytest + asyncio | Comprehensive test coverage |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated quality checks |

## 🏗️ **Architecture Highlights**

### **Intelligent Execution Engine**
```python
# Supports multiple execution modes with automatic fallback
async def _execute_code(self, code: str) -> str:
    # 1. Try WebSocket for real-time execution
    # 2. Fall back to HTTP API if needed
    # 3. Handle all output types (text, images, errors)
    # 4. Preserve execution metadata
```

### **Advanced Output Processing**
```python
# Captures and processes all Jupyter output types
def _process_outputs(self, outputs):
    # - execute_result: Code execution results
    # - display_data: Rich media (images, HTML)
    # - stream: stdout/stderr streams
    # - error: Exception tracebacks
```

### **Smart Image Extraction**
```python
# Multi-format image extraction with metadata preservation
async def _get_cell_image_output(self, cell_index: int) -> str:
    # - PNG/JPEG format detection
    # - Base64 encoding for AI consumption
    # - Metadata preservation
    # - Error handling for missing outputs
```
